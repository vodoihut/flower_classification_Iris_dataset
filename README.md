 Random Forest is an algorithm based on the principle of building multiple decision trees and combining results from them to make a final prediction. Random Forest's strength is its ability to handle large data and minimize overfitting.  Adaboost is an ensemble learning algorithm that focuses on improving performance by focusing on data points that previous models predicted incorrectly. By creating weak learners and focusing on improving them, Adaboost creates a stronger model.  By combining both algorithms, you can leverage the power of Random Forest in data processing and Adaboost's ability to improve model performance. The final result will be a flower classification model with good and stable prediction ability on the Iris dataset.
